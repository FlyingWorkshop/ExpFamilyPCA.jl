# Summary

Principal component analysis (PCA) [@PCA1; @PCA2; @PCA3] is popular for compressing, denoising, and interpreting high-dimensional data, but it can underperform on binary, count, and composition data because the model assumes data is normally distributed. Exponential family PCA (EPCA) [@EPCA] extends PCA to handle any exponential family distribution, making it more suitable for fields where these data types are common, such as geochemistry, marketing, genomics, political science, and machine learning [@composition; @elements].

`ExpFamilyPCA.jl` is a library for EPCA written in Julia, a dynamic language for scientific computing [@Julia]. It is the first EPCA package in Julia and the first in any language to support EPCA for multiple distributions.

# Statement of Need

EPCA has been applied in reinforcement learning [@Roy] and more recently in sample debiasing [@debiasing] and finance [@finance]. Wider adoption, however, remains limited due to the lack of implementations, with the only existing package supporting a single distribution in MATLAB [@epca-MATLAB]. This is surprising, as other Bregman-based optimization techniques have been successful in areas like mass spectrometry [@spectrum], ultrasound denoising [@ultrasound], topological data analysis [@topological], and robust clustering [@clustering]. These successes indicate that EPCA holds untapped potential in signal processing and machine learning.

The lack of a general EPCA library is likely due to engineering challenges. In widely used languages like Python and C, fast symbolic differentiation and optimization libraries are not typically interoperable. Julia, by contrast, uses multiple dispatch which promotes high levels of generic code reuse [@dispatch]. Multiple dispatch allows `ExpFamilyPCA.jl` to integrate fast symbolic differentiation [@symbolics], optimization [@optim], and numerically stable computation [@stable_exp] without requiring costly API conversions. As a result, `ExpFamilyPCA.jl` delivers speed, stability, and flexibility, with built-in support for most common distributions (ยง [Supported Distributions](#supported-distributions)) and flexible constructors for custom distributions (ยง [Custom Distributions](#supported-distributions)).

## Principal Component Analysis

### Geometric Interpretation

Given a data matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ with $n$ observations and $d$ features, PCA seeks the closest low-rank approximation $\Theta \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ by minimizing the reconstruction error

$$\begin{aligned}
& \underset{\Theta}{\text{minimize}}
& & \frac{1}{2}\|X - \Theta\|_F^2 \\
& \text{subject to}
& & \mathrm{rank}\left(\Theta\right) = k
\end{aligned}$$

where $\| \cdot \|_F$ denotes the Frobenius norm. The optimal $\Theta$ is a $k$-dimensional linear subspace that can be decomposed as the product of the compressed observations $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ and the basis $V \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times d}$:

$$
X \approx \Theta = AV.
$$

This suggests that each observation $x_i \in \mathrm{rows}(X)$ can be well-approximated by a linear combination of $k$ basis vectors (the rows of $V$):

$$
x_i \approx \theta_i = a_i V
$$

for $i = 1, \dots, n$.

### Probabilistic Interpretation

The PCA objective is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation for a Gaussian model. Under this lens, each observation $x_i$ is a noisy observation of a latent, low-rank structure $\theta_i$ corrupted with high-dimensional Gaussian noise

$$
x_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\theta_i, I).
$$

To recover the structure $\Theta$, PCA solves

$$\begin{aligned}
& \underset{\Theta}{\text{maximize}}
& & \sum_{i=1}^{n}\log \mathcal{L}(x_i; \theta_i) \\
& \text{subject to}
& & \mathrm{rank}\left(\Theta\right) = k
\end{aligned}$$

where $\mathcal{L}$ is the likelihood function.

## Exponential Family PCA

### Bregman Divergences

Bregman divergences [@Bregman; @Brad] are a measure of statistical difference that we can use to generalize the probablistic PCA objective to the exponential family. The Bregman divergence $B_F$ for a strictly convex, continuously differentiable function $F$ is

$$
B_F(p \| q) = F(p) - F(q) - \langle \nabla F(q), p - q \rangle.
$$

This can be interpreted as the difference between $F(p)$ and its linear approximation about $q$. When $F$ is taken to be the convex conjugate of the log-partition of an exponential family distribution, minimizing the Bregman divergence is the same as maximizing the corresponding log-likelihood [@azoury; @forster] (see [documentation](https://sisl.github.io/ExpFamilyPCA.jl/dev/math/bregman/)). Since the Gaussian distribution is in the exponential family, this means that Bregman divergences generalize the PCA objective.

### Parameter Duality

A fundamental component of EPCA is the convex conjugate, which bridges the natural and expectation parameters of an exponential family distribution. Given the log-partition function $G(\theta)$, its convex conjugate $F(\mu)$ is defined by

$$
F(\mu) = \sup_{\theta}(\langle \mu, \theta \rangle - G(\theta)),
$$

where $\mu = \nabla G(\theta)$ represents the expectation parameter correspondingto the natural parameter $\theta$. This duality ensures a smooth correspondence between the parameter spaces, facilitating efficient optimization and interpretation and is one of the principal benefits of EPCA over other similar methods. 

The link function $g(\theta) = \nabla G(\theta)$ serves a role analogous to that in generalized linear models (GLMs) [@GLM]. In GLMs, the link function connects the linear predictor to the mean of the distribution, enabling flexibility in modeling various data types. Similarly, in EPCA, the link function maps the low-dimensional latent variables to the expectation parameters of the exponential family, thereby generalizing the linear assumptions of traditional PCA to accommodate diverse distributions.

## Exponential Family PCA

EPCA generalizes the PCA objective as a Bregman divergence:

$$\begin{aligned}
& \underset{\Theta}{\text{minimize}}
& & B_F(X \| g(\Theta)) \\
& \text{subject to}
& & \mathrm{rank}\left(\Theta\right) = k
\end{aligned}$$
